I
walked
through
the
door
with
you
the
air
was
cold
But
somethin
bout
it
felt
like
home
somehow
And
I
left
my
scarf
there
at
your
sisters
house
And
youve
still
got
it
in
your
drawer
even
now
Oh
your
sweet
disposition
and
my
wideeyed
gaze
Were
singin
in
the
car
getting
lost
upstate
Autumn
leaves
fallin
down
like
pieces
into
place
And
I
can
picture
it
after
all
these
days
And
I
know
its
long
gone
and
That
magics
not
here
no
more
And
I
might
be
okay
but
Im
not
fine
at
all
Oh
oh
oh
Caus
there
we
ar
again
on
that
little
town
street
You
almost
ran
the
red
cause
you
were
lookin
over
at
me
Wind
in
my
hair
I
was
there
I
remember
it
all
too
well
Photo
album
on
the
counter
your
cheeks
were
turnin
red
You
used
to
be
a
little
kid
with
glasses
in
a
twinsized
bed
And
your
mothers
tellin
stories
bout
you
on
the
teeball
team
You
taught
me
bout
your
past
thinkin
your
future
was
me
And
you
were
tossing
me
the
car
keys
Bump
the
patriarchy
Keychain
on
the
ground
we
were
always
skippin
town
And
I
was
thinkin
on
the
drive
down
Any
time
now
Hes
gonna
say
its
love
you
never
called
it
what
it
was
Til
we
were
dead
and
gone
and
buried
Check
the
pulse
and
come
back
swearin
its
the
same
After
three
months
in
the
grave
And
then
you
wondered
where
it
went
to
as
I
reached
for
you
But
all
I
felt
was
shame
and
you
held
my
lifeless
frame
And
I
know
its
long
gone
and
There
was
nothing
else
I
could
do
And
I
forget
about
you
long
enough
To
forget
why
I
needed
to
Cause
there
we
are
again
in
the
middle
of
the
night
Were
dancin
round
the
kitchen
in
the
refrigerator
light
Down
the
stairs
I
was
there
I
remember
it
all
too
well
And
there
we
are
again
when
nobody
had
to
know
You
kept
me
like
a
secret
but
I
kept
you
like
an
oath
Sacred
prayer
and
wed
swear
To
remember
it
all
too
well
yeah
Well
maybe
we
got
lost
in
translation
maybe
I
asked
for
too
much
But
maybe
this
thing
was
a
masterpiece
til
you
tore
it
all
up
Runnin
scared
I
was
there
I
remember
it
all
too
well
And
you
call
me
up
again
just
to
break
me
like
a
promise
So
casually
cruel
in
the
name
of
bein
honest
Im
a
crumpledup
piece
of
paper
lyin
here
Cause
I
remember
it
all
all
all
They
say
alls
well
that
ends
well
but
Im
in
a
new
hell
Every
time
you
doublecross
my
mind
You
said
if
we
had
been
closer
in
age
maybe
it
wouldve
been
fine
And
that
made
me
want
to
die
The
idea
you
had
of
me
who
was
she
A
neverneedy
everlovely
jewel
whose
shine
reflects
on
you
Not
weepin
in
a
party
bathroom
Some
actress
askin
me
what
happened
you
Thats
what
happened
you
You
who
charmed
my
dad
with
selfeffacing
jokes
Sippin
coffee
like
youre
on
a
latenight
show
But
then
he
watched
me
watch
the
front
door
all
night
willin
you
to
come
And
he
said
Its
supposed
to
be
fun
turning
twentyone
Time
wont
fly
its
like
Im
paralyzed
by
it
Id
like
to
be
my
old
self
again
but
Im
still
tryin
to
find
it
After
plaid
shirt
days
and
nights
when
you
made
me
your
own
Now
you
mail
back
my
things
and
I
walk
home
alone
But
you
keep
my
old
scarf
from
that
very
first
week
Cause
it
reminds
you
of
innocence
and
it
smells
like
me
You
cant
get
rid
of
it
Cause
you
remember
it
all
too
well
yeah
Cause
there
we
are
again
when
I
loved
you
so
Back
before
you
lost
the
one
real
thing
youve
ever
known
It
was
rare
I
was
there
I
remember
it
all
too
well
Wind

You

And
I
was
never
good
at
tellin
jokes
but
the
punch
line
goes
Ill

older
but
your
lovers

my
age
From
when
your
Brooklyn
broke
my
skin
and
bones
Im
a
soldier
whos
returning
half
her
weight
And
did
the
twin
flame
bruise
paint
you
blue
Just
between
us
did
the
love
affair
maim
you
too
Cause
in
this
citys
barren
cold
I
still
remember
the
first
fall
of
snow
And
how
it
glistened
as
it
fell
I
remember
it
all
too
well
Just
between
us
did
the
love
affair
maim
you
all
too
well
Just
between
us
do
you
remember
it
all
too
well
Just
between

well
Wind

Down

I
was

Sacred

It
was
rare
you

it
all
too
well
Wind
in
my
hair

Down

Down

It

Vintage
tee
brand
new
phone
High
heels
on
cobblestones
When
you
are
young
they
assume
you
knownothing
Sequinsmile
black
lipstick
Sensualpolitics
When
you
are
young
they
assumeyou
know
nothing
But
I
knew
you
Dancin
in
your
Levis
Drunk
under
a
streetlight
I
I
knew
you
Hand
under
my
sweatshirt
Baby
kiss
it
better
I
And
when
I
felt
like
I
was
an
old
cardigan
Under
someones
bed
You
put
me
on
and
said
I
was
your
favorite
A
friend
to
all
is
a
friend
to
none
Chase
two
girls
lose
the
one
When
you
are
young
they
assume
you
know
nothing
But
I
knew
you
Playing
hideandseek
and
Giving
me
your
weekends
I
I
knew
you
Your
heartbeat
on
the
High
Line
Once
in
twenty
lifetimes
I
And
when
I
felt
like
I
was
an
old
cardigan
Under
someones
bed
You
put
me
on
and
said
I
was
your
favorite
To
kiss
in
cars
and
downtown
bars
Was
all
we
needed
You
drew
stars
around
my
scars
But
now
Im
bleedin
Cause
I
knew
you
Steppin
on
the
last
train
Marked
me
like
a
bloodstain
I
I
knew
you
Tried
to
change
the
ending
Peter
losing
Wendy
I
I
knew
you
Leavin
like
a
father
Running
like
water
I
And
when
you
are
young
they
assume
you
know
nothing
But
I
knew
youd
linger
like
a
tattoo
kiss
I
knew
youd
haunt
all
of
my
whatifs
The
smell
of
smoke
would
hang
around
this
long
Cause
I
knew
everything
when
I
was
young
I
knew
Id
curse
you
for
the
longest
time
Chasin
shadows
in
the
grocery
line
I
knew
youd
miss
me
once
the
thrill
expired
And
youd
be
standin
in
my
front
porch
light
And
I
knew
youd
come
back
to
me
Youd
come
back
to
me
And
youd
come
back
to
me
And
youd
come
back
And
when
I
felt
like
I
was
an
old
cardigan
Under
someones
bed
You
put
me
on
and
said
I
was
your
favorite
We
could
leave
the
Christmas
lights
up
til
January

You
were
in
college
working
part
time
waitin
tables
Left
a
small
town
never
looked
back
I
was
a
flight
risk
with
a
fear
of
falling
Wonderin
why
we
bother
with
love
if
it
never
lasts
I
say
Can
you
believe
it
As
were
lyin
on
the
couch
The
moment
I
could
see
it
Yes
yes
I
can
see
it
now
Do
you
remember
we
were
sittin
there
by
the
water
You
put
your
arm
around
me
for
the
first
time
You
made
a
rebel
of
a
careless
mans
careful
daughter
You
are
the
best
thing
thats
ever
been
mine
Flash
forward
and
were
takin
on
the
world
together
And
theres
a
drawer
of
my
things
at
your
place
You
learn
my
secrets
and
you
figure
out
why
Im
guarded
You
say
well
never
make
my
parents
mistakes
But
we
got
bills
to
pay
We
got
nothing
figured
out
When
it
was
hard
to
take
Yes
yes
this
is
what
I
thought
about
Do
you
remember
we
were
sittin
there
by
the
water
You
put
your
arm
around
me
for
the
first
time
You
made
a
rebel
of
a
careless
mans
careful
daughter
You
are
the
best
thing
thats
ever
been
mine
Do
you
remember
all
the
city
lights
on
the
water
You
saw
me
start
to
believe
for
the
first
time
You
made
a
rebel
of
a
careless
mans
careful
daughter
You
are
the
best
thing
thats
ever
been
mine
Ohoh
ohoh
And
I
remember
that
fight

AM
As
everything
was
slipping
right
out
of
our
hands
I
ran
out
crying
and
you
followed
me
out
into
the
street
Braced
myself
for
the
goodbye
Cause
thats
all
Ive
ever
known
Then
you
took
me
by
surprise
You
said
Ill
never
leave
you
alone
You
said
I
remember
how
we
felt
sitting
by
the
water
And
every
time
I
look
at
you
its
like
the
first
time
I
fell
in
love
with
a
careless
mans
careful
daughter
She
is
the
best
thing
thats
ever
been
mine
Hold
on
make
it
last
Hold
on
never
turn
back
You
made
a
rebel
of
a
careless
mans
careful
daughter
You
are
the
best
thing
thats
ever
been
mine
Yes
yes
do
you
believe
it
Yes
yes
were
gonna
make
it
now
Yes
yes
I
can
see
it
Yes
yes
I
can
see
it
now
We
were
both
young
when
I
first
saw
you
I
close
my
eyes
and
the
flashback
starts
Im
standing
there
On
a
balcony
in
summer
air
See
the
lights
see
the
party
the
ball
gowns
See

make
your
way
through
the
crowd
And
say
Hello
Little

I
know
That
you
were
Romeo

were
throwing
pebbles
And
my
daddy
said
Stay
away
from
Juliet
And
I
was
crying
on
the
staircase
Begging
you
Please

and
I
said

And

prettiest
lady
in

when
I
was
wrong

Loving
him
is
like
driving
a
new
Maserati
down
a
deadend
street
Faster
than
the
wind
passionate
as
sin
ending
so
suddenly
Loving
him
is
like
trying
to
change
your
mind
once
youre
already
flying
through
the
free
fall
Like
the
colors
in
autumn
so
bright
just
before
they
lose
it
all
Losing
him
was
blue
like
Id
never
known
Missing
him
was
dark
gray
all
alone
Forgetting
him
was
like
trying
to
know
somebody
youve
never
met
But
loving
him
was
red
Loving
him
was
red
Touching
him
was
like
realizing
all
you
ever
wanted
was
right
there
in
front
of
you
Memorizing
him
was
as
easy
as
knowing
all
the
words
to
your
old
favorite
song
Fighting
with
him
was
like
trying
to
solve
a
crossword
and
realizing
theres
no
right
answer
Regretting
him
was
like
wishing
you
never
found
out
that
love
could
be
that
strong
Losing
him
was
blue
like
Id
never
known
Missing
him
was
dark
gray
all
alone
Forgetting
him
was
like
trying
to
know
somebody
youve
never
met
But
loving
him
was
red
Oh
red
Burning
red
Remembering
him
comes
in
flashbacks
and
echoes
Tell
myself
its
time
now
gotta
let
go
But
moving
on
from
him
is
impossible
When
I
still
see
it
all
in
my
head
In
burning
red
Burning
it
was
red
Oh
losing
him
was
blue
like
Id
never
known
Missing
him
was
dark
gray
all
alone
Forgetting
him
was
like
trying
to
know
somebody
youve
never
met
Cause
loving
him
was
red
Yeah
yeah
red
Burning
red
And
thats
why
hes
spinning
round
in
my
head
Comes
back
to
me

burning
red
Yeah
yeah
His
love
was
like
driving
a
new
Maserati
down
a
deadend
street
It
feels
like
a
perfect
night
To
dress
up
like
hipsters
And
make
fun
of
our
exes
Uhuh
uhuh
It
feels
like
a
perfect
night
For
breakfast
at
midnight
To
fall
in
love
with
strangers
Uhuh

Yeah
Were
happy
free
confused
and
lonely
at
the
same
time
Its
miserable
and
magical
