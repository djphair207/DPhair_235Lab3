I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

[Verse 2]
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, "Fuck the patriarchy"
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, "Any time now
He's gonna say it's love," you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

[Bridge]
Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
[Verse 4]
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, "It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one"

[Verse 5]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 6]
And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age"
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

[Outro]
Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it (All too well)
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it

[Verse 1]
Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Chorus]
But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I
[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Verse 2]
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Chorus]
But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Bridge]
To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'
[Chorus]
'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Verse 3]
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back
[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Verse 1]
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover
[Verse 2]
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Bridge]
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover

[Verse 1]
I stay out too late
Got nothin' in my brain
That's what people say, mmm-mmm
That's what people say, mmm-mmm
I go on too many dates (Haha)
But I can't make them stay
At least that's what people say, mmm-mmm
That's what people say, mmm-mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
But I keep cruisin'
Can't stop, won't stop movin'
It's like I got this music in my mind
Sayin', "It's gonna be alright"
[Chorus]
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

[Verse 2]
I never miss a beat
I'm lightnin' on my feet
And that's what they don't see, mmm-mmm
That's what they don't see, mmm-mmm
I'm dancin' on my own (Dancin' on my own)
I make the moves up as I go (Moves up as I go)
And that's what they don't know, mmm-mmm
That's what they don't know, mmm-mmm

[Pre-Chorus]
But I keep cruisin'
Can't stop, won't stop groovin'
It's like I got this music in my mind
Sayin', "It's gonna be alright"
[Chorus]
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

[Post-Chorus]
Shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off

[Interlude]
Hey, hey, hey
Just think, while you've been gettin' down and out about the liars
And the dirty, dirty cheats of the world
You could've been gettin' down
To this sick beat

[Bridge]
My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
She's like, "Oh my God!" But I'm just gonna shake
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Won't you come on over, baby?
We can shake, shake, shake
Yeah, oh, oh, oh
[Chorus]
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
(Haters gonna hate)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off (Ha!)
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break (Mmm)
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
(And fake, and fake, and fake)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off (I, I, I)

[Post-Chorus]
Shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
Shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off (Yeah!)
Shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off (You got to)
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off

[Verse 1]
The moon is high
Like your friends were the night that we first met
Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet
Now I've read all of the books beside your bed
The wine is cold
Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street
Cat and mouse for a month or two or three
Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ayy)
Kiss me once 'cause you know I had a long night (Oh)
Kiss me twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)
Three times 'cause I waited my whole life (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)
[Chorus]
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams
Oh, you're the one I want

[Verse 2]
In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool
When you jumped in first, I went in too
I'm with you even if it makes me blue
Which takes me back
To the color that we painted your brother's wall
Honey, without all the exes, fights, and flaws
We wouldn't be standing here so tall, so

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ayy)
Kiss you once 'cause I know you had a long night (Oh)
Kiss you twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)
Three times 'cause you waited your whole life (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)
Ah
[Chorus]
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams
Oh, you're the one I want

[Bridge]
I want to drive away with you
I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays
Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
I want to drive away with you
I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays
Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
Uh huh

[Chorus]
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Ah-ah, that's right, you're the one I want
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Ah-ah, darling, you're the one I want
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in all my dreams
You're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in all my dreams
Oh, you're the one I want
[Outro]
You're the one I want, one I want
You're the one I want, one I want

[Intro]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
You were in college working part time waitin' tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wonderin' why we bother with love if it never lasts

[Pre-Chorus]
I say, "Can you believe it?"
As we're lyin' on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now
[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Verse 2]
Flash forward and we're takin' on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

[Pre-Chorus]
But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about

[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Bridge]
And I remember that fight, 2:30 A.M
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said, "I'll never leave you alone"

[Chorus]
You said, "I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine"

[Post-Chorus]
Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back
(Hold on) You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter (Make it last)
(Hold on) You are the best thing that's ever been mine (Hold on)

[Outro]
Yes, yes, do you believe it? (Hold on)
Yes, yes, we're gonna make it now (Hold on)
Yes, yes, I can see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

[Verse 1]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello"
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please, don't go," and I said
[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say "Yes"

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, "Please, don't go," and I said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say "Yes"
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say "Yes"
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

[Breakdown]
And I said, "Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said

[Chorus]
"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'"

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you

[Verse 1]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there, and I thought
"Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"
Ayy

[Verse 2]
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mmm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

[Verse 3]
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Oh, no

[Verse 4]
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing, like
"Oh my God, who is she?"
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mmm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Oh)
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless (Oh-oh), mmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane (Insane)
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
[Bridge]
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over (Over), mmm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane (I'm insane)
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game (And you love the game)
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Yeah)
We'll take this way too far (Ooh)
It'll leave you breathless, mmm
Or with a nasty scar (With a nasty scar)
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

[Verse 1]
I like the way you sound in the morning
We're on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound
I have ever heard
I like the way I can't keep my focus
I watch you talk, you didn't notice
I hear the words but all I can think is
We should be together

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you
[Chorus]
Whoa oh, I'm feeling you, baby
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall

[Verse 2]
Well I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me
I love each freckle on your face, oh
I've never been so wrapped up, honey
I like the way you're everything I ever wanted
I had time to think it o-over
And all I can say is come closer
Take a deep breath and jump then fall into me

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

[Chorus]
Whoa oh, I'm feeling you, baby
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall
[Bridge]
The bottom's gonna drop out from under our feet
I'll catch you, I'll catch you
When people say things that bring you to your knees
I'll catch you
The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry
But I'll hold you through the night until you smile

[Chorus]
Whoa oh, I need you, baby
Don't be afraid, please
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall
Jump then fall, baby
Jump then fall into me, into me

[Outro]
Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I shine
And every time you're here
Baby, I'll show you, I'll show you
You can jump then fall, jump then fall
Jump then fall into me, into me, yeah

[Verse 1]
There's something 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
We're driving down the road, I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absentmindedly making me want you
[Chorus]
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you, I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

[Verse 3]
So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road
In this one horse town, I wanna stay right here
In this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you, I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

[Bridge]
Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake, I'm not usually this way but
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something
It's fearless
Oh, yeah
[Chorus]
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you, I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you, I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home

[Chorus]
I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today
[Verse 2]
I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names

[Chorus]
I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today

[Bridge]
I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother, inside and out
He's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you

[Verse 3]
There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs
And Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world
[Chorus]
And now I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
For staying back and watching me shine
And I didn't know if you knew, so I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day with you today

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me
You found me-e-e-e-e
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me
Without me-e-e-e-e
[Pre-Chorus]
And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

[Chorus]
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

[Verse 2]
No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning
You're drowning-ing-ing-ing-ing
And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now, I see, now, I see
Now, I see-e-e-e-e
[Pre-Chorus]
He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, yeah

[Chorus]
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Oh)
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (Yeah)
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble (Yeah, trouble)
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

[Bridge]
And the saddest fear
Comes creeping in
That you never loved me
Or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah
[Chorus]
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (Never been)
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Knew it right there)
So shame on me now (Knew it right there)
Flew me to places I'd never been (Ooh)
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble (Oh)
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble

[Outro]

[Verse 1]
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red
[Post-Chorus]
(Red, red)
(Red, red)
Loving him was red
(Red, red)
(Red, red)

[Verse 2]
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Whoa)
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red

[Post-Chorus]
(Red, red)
Oh, red (Red, red)
Burning red (Red, red)
(Red, red)

[Bridge]
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning, it was red
[Chorus]
Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Whoa)
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
'Cause loving him was red

[Post-Chorus]
(Red, red) Yeah, yeah, red (Red, red)
Burning red (Red, red)
(Red, red)

[Breakdown]
And that's why (Red, red) he's spinning 'round in my head
Comes back to me (Red, red), burning red
(Red, red) Yeah, yeah
(Red, red)

[Outro]
His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street

[Verse 1]
It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes
Uh-uh, uh-uh
It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
Uh-uh, uh-uh

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah
We're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time, oh-oh
[Chorus]
I don't know about you
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like we're
Twenty-two, twenty-two

[Verse 2]
It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids
Uh-uh, uh-uh (Who's Taylor Swift, anyway? Ew)
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreamin'
Instead of sleeping

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah
We're happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time, oh-oh
[Chorus]
(Hey!) I don't know about you
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if (Ooh)
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if (Alright)
We just keep dancing like we're
Twenty-two (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh), twenty-two (I don't know about you)
Twenty-two, twenty-two (Ooh)

[Bridge]
It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleepin'
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you (You)
Woah, ooh, yeah, eh-yeah

[Chorus]
(Hey!) I don't know about you (I don't know about you)
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if (Ooh)
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me (You don't know about me)
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like we're (Dancing like we're twenty-two)
Twenty-two (Woah-oh), twenty-two (Dancing like)
Twenty-two (Yeah, yeah), twenty-two (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Outro]
It feels like one of those nights (Twenty-two)
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights (Twenty-two)
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights (Twenty-two)
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you
